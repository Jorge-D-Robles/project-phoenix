# Roadmap Health Audit

Evaluates the current state of `agents/ROADMAP.md` and `agents/TASKS.md`.

## Workflow
1. **Velocity Check**: Compare the completion date of recent `DONE` tickets in `TASKS.md` with the estimated timelines in `ROADMAP.md`.
2. **Health Metrics Audit**:
    - Verify "Project Health" indicators in `ROADMAP.md`.
    - Check for "Blocked" tasks and identify the root cause of bottlenecks.
3. **Phase Alignment**: Ensure that all tasks required for the current Phase are either `DONE` or `IN_PROGRESS`.

## Goal
Provide a realistic assessment of whether the project will meet its next major deliverable deadline.
