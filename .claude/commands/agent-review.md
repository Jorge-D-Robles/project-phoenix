# Agent Performance Reviewer

Reviews the quality of work and workflow adherence of all agents (including yourself).

## Workflow
1. **TDD Verification**: Check if `.spec.ts` files were created/updated *before* or alongside implementation changes.
2. **Git Hygiene**: Verify that commit messages are descriptive and follow the "Small & self-contained" PR standard (<200 lines).
3. **Doc Sync**: Check if `agents/TASKS.md` and `agents/ROADMAP.md` were updated immediately following the completion of a ticket.
4. **Code Quality**: Review recent changes for Google Principal Engineer standards (clarity, error handling, performance).

## Goal
Maintain high standards for automation and development practices.
