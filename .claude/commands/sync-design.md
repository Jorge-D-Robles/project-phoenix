Re-read design.md and update all docs/ files to stay in sync.

## Instructions

1. Read `design.md` in full
2. For each file in `docs/`:
   - Compare its content against the corresponding section(s) in `design.md`
   - Update any content that has drifted from the canonical spec
   - Preserve the agent-optimized format (imperative language, checklists, tables)
   - Do not remove agent checklists or implementation instructions
3. If new sections were added to `design.md` that don't have a corresponding `docs/` file, create one following the existing naming convention (lowercase-kebab-case.md)
4. Report what changed in each file (or "no changes needed")
