# docs/ — Agent Reference Documents

- Purpose: Agent-consumable reference docs distilled from design.md
- Relationship: design.md is canonical; these are refined working references
- If design.md changes: run /sync-design to regenerate
- Naming: lowercase-kebab-case.md
- Style: imperative, checklists, tables — optimized for AI agents
